Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV

Objective:

To improve machine learning model performance by optimizing hyperparameters using GridSearchCV with cross-validation.

Concept:

Machine learning models have parameters that control how they learn. Instead of manually choosing them, GridSearchCV automatically tests multiple parameter combinations and selects the best-performing model.

Dataset:

Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (from sklearn library)

Tools Used:

 Python
 scikit-learn
 Pandas
 Jupyter Notebook


Implementation Steps:


1. Loaded dataset
2. Performed train-test split
3. Trained default Random Forest model
4. Defined hyperparameter grid
5. Applied GridSearchCV with cross-validation
6. Extracted best parameters
7. Compared tuned vs default model performance

Results:

Best hyperparameters identified using GridSearchCV
Tuned model achieved better accuracy than default model
Demonstrated model optimization using cross-validation


Learning Outcome:

Understanding hyperparameters

Model optimization techniques
Cross-validation concept
Performance comparison methodology
